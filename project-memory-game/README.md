## About

Memory game is a very popular card matching game that tests your memory skills.

This browser-based game was developed as part of the Udacity Front-end Nanodegree program.

## Instructions

Click on any two cards on the game board to turn them face-up to reveal their symbols or suits. If the two cards match, they remain open. However, if they do not match, they will be turned face-down again.

You win the game by matching all the cards on the game board.
