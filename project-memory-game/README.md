# Memory Game Project

Memory game is a very popular card matching game that tests your memory skills. This browser-based game was developed as part of the Udacity Front-end Nanodegree program.


## Instructions

Click on any two cards on the game board to turn them face-up to reveal their symbols or suits. If the two cards match, they remain open. However, if they do not match, they will be turned face-down again.

You win the game by matching all the cards on the game board.


## Implementation

The game has been developed using **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and vanilla **Javascript**. No frameworks or libraries were used.

The game is responsive and should work in modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers, including IE9 and later.
